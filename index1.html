                        <p>The internet was created by people that connected their networks and allowed traffic from, to and over their servers and cables to pass for free. As a result, there was abundant data communication and exponential innovation. <br/><br/>The Things Network is doing the same for the Internet of Things by creating abundant data connectivity. So applications and businesses can flourish.</p>

                        <p>Amsterdam has a lot of boats and unfortunately also quite some rain. It is not uncommon to have boats filling up with water and starting to sink. A water detector was developed that recognizes if your boat is filling up with water. If this happens the owner receives a SMS. On a return SMS of “clear my boat” a service will come by to remove the water.
